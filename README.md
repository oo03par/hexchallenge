# HEX Challenge
Holiday Extras remote code challenge

## Pre-Requisites
The following are pre-requisite of the project:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - built with version 4.4.7
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - built with version 2.15.8

Please check the project out and run the following command to update local packages etc.:

```
npm update
```

## Running
Run the following command from the root folder of the application

```
node app.js
```

This will start the application on port 8080 - point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/ to see the homepage.

## Testing
Tests have been written using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) JavaScript test framework - to execute the tests, run

```
npm test
```

## Notes
The project has been written using a TDD approach. Unit tests can be found under the _test_ folder.
I chose the technology stack (Node and Express) as this is, what I understand, is used at Holiday Extras. This also provided me with a further challenge to up my JavaScript skills.
